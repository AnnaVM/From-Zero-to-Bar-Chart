# Zero to Bar Chart with D3 v4

### Who this is for
- Beginners
- Transitioning D3 v3 Users

### How to use this
Get comfortable with a nice text editor, browser and console open as you step through the process of creating a bar chart in D3 v4. I encourage you to branch out along the way adding your own styles. After you have given this documentation a once over you may want to add your own data. I would love to see you [create you own blocks](https://bost.ocks.org/mike/block/) to reference later. Your blocks are also helpful for other just getting started.
